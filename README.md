# Elite-Explorer-Dashboard-V2
## What Is It?
Elite Explorer Dashboard V2 is the second iteration of a project I started about three years ago. I tested many different ways to process this data. All the different setups I tested involved some kind of server, database engine, and other technologies that I tied together while trying to build what this project brings. Anyone trying to replicate the previous experiments would probably pull their hair out trying to glue all of it together with Perl and JavaScript.

So I decided to rewrite the whole thing as a Windows native application using C#. Elite Dangerous only runs reliaibly in Windows and C# was the quickest language for me to pick up, so here we are.

This project was stalled for a few months while built my blog at https://baremetalbridge.com and adjusted to a new job but now I am ready to get back to it. Generally this did the basic things I needed but the code was a spahgetti mess of learning and experimenting at the same time.

In the very beginning all variables were global and function calls were a comedy at best. It got to a point at times that it would not run because there were so many global variables and bad function calls. I cleaned it up enough to work for me and left it at that. Now, as I have dove deeper into DevOps and proper development procedures I can see that it is time to start this over from the beginning with a completely different mindset.

I will have a cleaner more durable program. You will see a much better approach to how it is done. Of course you have to have Elite Dangerous to use the system realtime but when I think the program is ready I will upload a curated selection of my Elite Dangerous data for you to work with.
